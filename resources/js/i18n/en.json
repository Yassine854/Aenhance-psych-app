    "questions": {
      "q1": {
        "question": "What's the difference between psychologists and psychiatrists, and how do I choose the right mental health professional for my needs?",
        "answer": {
          "p1": "Psychologists and psychiatrists are both mental health professionals (experts), but they have different approaches and qualifications.",
          "p2": "Psychologists offer therapy and counseling with a master's or PhD. Psychiatrists are doctors who can prescribe medication along with therapy.",
          "p3": "To choose the right professional, consider your specific needs. If you're looking for therapy without medication, a psychologist may be suitable. If medication is a potential part of your treatment, consider a psychiatrist or a combined approach with both. Don't hesitate to ask if they think the other professional could help you too."
        }
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "How can I determine if online therapy is the right option for me?",
        "answer": "Online therapy can be an excellent choice for many people. It offers flexibility, easy access, and a wide range of qualified therapists. To see if it suits you, consider your comfort with technology, your schedule, and discussing personal matters online. Many individuals find online therapy helpful, but it's essential to assess your own preferences and needs."

How long you continue therapy depends on your unique needs and goals. Some people prefer shorter-term (a few weeks to months), while others go for longer to address more complex issues. Your therapist will help figure out the best plan for you."

        }
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "What can I expect during my first therapy session?",
        "answer": "Your first therapy session, known as the intake session, often called an intake session, is an opportunity to know your therapist and talk about your goals and concerns. You'll discuss why you're in therapy and what you hope to achieve. Your therapist may ask about your past history, current challenges, and any relevant background details. This meeting sets the foundation for your therapeutic journey and helps build a connection between you and your therapist."

          "step1": "Think about what you want to talk about during your session. Consider your thoughts, feelings, and specific concerns you want to address.",
          "step2": "Find a quiet and private space for your session. This way, you can focus without any disturbances or interruptions.",
          "step3": "Ensure that your camera and microphone are working well, and choose a place with good lighting.",
          "step4": "Try to be open and honest during your sessions. Effective therapy requires clear and open communication between you and your therapist."
        }
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "What should I do if I experience technical difficulties during my online therapy session?",
        "answer": "If you encounter technical issues during your online therapy session, don't worry. First, try refreshing your browser or restarting your device.
